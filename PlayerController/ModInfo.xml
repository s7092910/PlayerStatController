		<Description value="A Modder Friendly Custom Controller for 7 Days to Die.
		The controller can be used as a standalone as it includes many Player stat xml bindings.
		Or the parts of the Controller can be extended to include new custom xml bindings created 
		by another modder without requiring using Harmony or modifying the source code of the PlayerStatController.
		See the PlayerStatControllerExtentionExample project to see how to add custom xml bindings to the controller
		
		If you as a modder want to include this in your mod, you are free to do so" />
